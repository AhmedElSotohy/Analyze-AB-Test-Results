# Analyze-AB-Test-Results

Project Challenge: An e-commerce company wanted to increase the number of users who “convert” or decide to pay for their product. They developed a new web page and ran an A/B test to compare its performance against the old page. The challenge was to analyze the A/B test results and help the company make an informed decision on whether to implement the new page, keep the old page, or run the experiment longer.

Project Solution: I conducted a thorough analysis of the A/B test results, using statistical methods to assess the impact of countries and the interaction between page and country on conversion rates. My analysis showed that there was no statistical evidence to confirm that using the new page led to more conversions, with all p-values being larger than our significance level of α0.05​/5%.
Based on these findings, my recommendation was that the company fails to reject the null hypothesis and should continue using their old page.

I demonstrated strong analytical skills and attention to detail while conducting this analysis, carefully interpreting the data and providing insights on the difficulties of interpreting the coefficients due to the addition of an interaction term. My ability to deliver a comprehensive and data-driven solution showcased my proficiency in data analysis and A/B testing.
